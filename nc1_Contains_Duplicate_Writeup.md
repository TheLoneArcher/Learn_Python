### **Solving "Contains Duplicate": A Comparison of Four Approaches**

Here are four different methods to determine if an array contains any duplicate elements, ranging from the most basic to the most efficient.

---

### **Approach 1: Brute Force**

#### **Intuition & Explanation**
The brute-force approach is the most straightforward solution. It involves iterating through the array and comparing each element with every other element that comes after it. If a matching pair is found, we know a duplicate exists and can immediately return `True`. If the loops complete without finding any matches, it means all elements are unique.

#### **Code**
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                    return True
        return False
```

#### **Analysis**
*   **Time Complexity: `O(n²)`**
    This is due to the nested loops. For each element, we scan the rest of the array, leading to a quadratic runtime.
*   **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
    No extra data structures are used, so the space required is constant.
*   **Verdict:** Too slow for large inputs and will likely result in a **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** error on most platforms.

### **Approach 2: Sorting**

#### **Intuition & Explanation**
If an array is sorted, any duplicate elements will be grouped together. This insight allows for a more efficient check. By first sorting the array, we only need to make a single pass and compare each element to its immediate neighbor. If any adjacent elements are identical, we have found a duplicate.

#### **Code**
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        nums.sort()  # Sort the array first
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Check if the current element is the same as the previous one
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                return True
        return False
```

#### **Analysis**
*   **Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`**
    The overall runtime is dominated by the sorting algorithm. The subsequent linear scan takes only O(n) time.
*   **Space Complexity: `O(1)` or `O(n)`**
    The space complexity depends on the implementation of the sorting algorithm. Some, like Heapsort, are in-place (`O(1)`). However, Python's `Timsort` can use up to `O(n)` space.
*   **Verdict:** A significant improvement over the brute-force method and a valid, common solution.

### **Approach 3: Using a Hash Set**

#### **Intuition & Explanation**
A hash set offers average O(1) time for insertions and lookups. We can leverage this speed by iterating through the input array once. For each element, we first check if it already exists in our `seen` set. If it does, we've found a duplicate and return `True`. If not, we add the element to the set and continue.

#### **Code**
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(num)
        return False
```

#### **Analysis**
*   **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**
    We iterate through the array of `n` elements exactly once. Each hash set operation (lookup and add) takes O(1) time on average.
*   **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**
    In the worst-case scenario (an array with all unique elements), the hash set will grow to store all `n` elements.
*   **Verdict:** Generally the most efficient and Pythonic solution in terms of time complexity.

### **Approach 4: Using a Hash Map (Frequency Counter)**

#### **Intuition & Explanation**
This approach is very similar to using a hash set but uses a hash map (a dictionary in Python) to store element frequencies. As we iterate, if we encounter a number that is already a key in our map, we know it's a duplicate. Otherwise, we add the number to the map. While this works perfectly, it stores counts, which is more information than is strictly needed to solve this problem.

#### **Code**
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        seen = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                return True
            seen[num] = 1 # Mark the number as seen
        return False
```

#### **Analysis**
*   **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**
    Like the hash set approach, this involves a single pass through the array with O(1) average time for hash map operations.
*   **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**
    In the worst case (no duplicates), the hash map will store all `n` unique elements as keys.
*   **Verdict:** Functionally identical in performance to the hash set for this specific problem. However, the hash set is slightly more direct as it perfectly represents the logic of "have I seen this before?".
